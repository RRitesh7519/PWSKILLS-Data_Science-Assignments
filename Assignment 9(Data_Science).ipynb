In contrast, a regular neural network consists solely of fully connected layers, where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous and next layers.\n",

They perform convolution operations, which involve sliding a small filter/kernel over the input data to extract local patterns and features. These filters help the CNN capture spatial hierarchies and detect patterns at different scales. In regular neural networks, there are no convolutional layers, and each neuron connects to all neurons in the previous and next layers.\n",

    "Pooling Layers: CNNs often include pooling layers after convolutional layers. Pooling helps downsample the spatial dimensions of the data, reducing its size and the number of parameters in subsequent layers. Typical pooling operations include max pooling or average pooling.

    "Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the input feature maps. This reduction helps in compressing the information and capturing the most salient features while discarding irrelevant details.

By selecting the maximum (max pooling) or average (average pooling) value within a region, pooling layers capture the presence of important patterns while reducing the impact of noise or minor variations. This pooling operation helps in enhancing the robustness and generalization capability of the CNN.\n",

    "Computational Efficiency:\n",

This efficiency is particularly beneficial in large-scale CNN architectures where the number of parameters can quickly grow, and computational resources become a limiting factor.\n",

    "Different Pooling Operations:\n",
    "Common types of pooling operations used in CNNs are max pooling and average pooling. Max pooling selects the maximum value within each pooling region, effectively highlighting the most prominent features. On the other hand, average pooling calculates the average value within each region, providing a more smoothed representation of the data."

    "Neural networks can be used for regression tasks by modifying the output layer and loss function. For regression, the output layer typically consists of a single neuron, and the activation function used can be linear or identity function. The loss function used is often mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE), which quantifies the discrepancy between the predicted values and the true continuous target values. By adjusting the network architecture and training process, neural networks can learn to approximate and predict continuous output values for regression tasks."
